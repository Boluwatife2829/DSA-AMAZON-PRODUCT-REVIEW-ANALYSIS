# DSA-AMAZON-PRODUCT-REVIEW-ANALYSIS
Data analysis of Amazon product reviews using Excel – pivot tables, dashboards, and business insights.

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### 🔍 Project Overview
This project is part of a case study at RetailTech Insights where I worked as a Junior Data Analyst. The goal was to analyze Amazon product and customer review data to provide insights that support product development, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including:

Product details: name, category, price, discount, ratings.

Customer engagement: reviews, content, and titles.

### 📊 Analysis Goals
Using Excel pivot tables and calculated columns, I answered the following:

1. What’s the average discount percentage by product category?

2. How many products are listed under each category?

3. Total number of reviews per category?

4. Products with the highest average rating?

5. Average actual price vs discounted price per category.

6. Products with the highest number of reviews.

7. Count of products with discounts ≥ 50%.

8. Distribution of ratings (e.g. how many are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc)?

9. Total potential revenue by category.

10. Number of unique products per price range (e.g., < ₦200, ₦200–₦500, ₦500+).

11. Does rating relate to level of discount?

112. Products with < 1,000 reviews?

Categories with highest discounts.
