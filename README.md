### 📁 Dataset Description

### 📊 Analysis Goals
Using Excel pivot tables and calculated columns, I answered the following:

1. What’s the average discount percentage by product category?

2. How many products are listed under each category?

3. Total number of reviews per category?

4. Products with the highest average rating?

5. Average actual price vs discounted price per category.

6. Products with the highest number of reviews.

7. Count of products with discounts ≥ 50%.

8. Distribution of ratings (e.g. how many are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc)?

9. Total potential revenue by category.

10. Number of unique products per price range (e.g., < ₦200, ₦200–₦500, ₦500+).

11. Does rating relate to level of discount?

12. Products with < 1,000 reviews?

13. Categories with highest discounts.

14. Top 5 products in terms of rating and review count.
